## Background

Welcome to the newsroom! Data visualization for a major metro paper.I analyzed the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.

Data analytics for editor to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. Information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

* The data is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

The visualization includes a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

* The scatter plot represents each state with circle elements, state abbreviations in the circles, with axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
